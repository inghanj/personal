<p>I make electronic and noise music with Ableton and Ultrabox (though most of my stuff was made with Jummbox). I've dabbled a bit with FL Studio and Reaper, I've tried famiTracker too, but right now, my main focus is getting used to Ableton.
I also use Ableton to record guitar demos. I don't have any finished songs yet, but hopefully that'll change soon.</p>

<p>15/6/24: Some songs I've played/are working on are No Remorse by Metallica and Ex-Creations by Fall of Troy (going to try and record these some time). I mostly play indie/alt rock and metal adjacent stuff but I also dabble in a bit of jazz. 

<p>Guitar: Ibanez gio</p>
<p>Amp: crush 35RT</p>
<p> I started on a cheap yamaha classical guitar</p>

<p>Besides guitar I also play piano and percussion in school band. I'm working on a beethoven (??? check this).</p>

<div id="art">
<h2>art</h2>
<p>[...]And that's really my main visual art form, I do paint but I genuinely suck at it (trying to get better though). I prefer traditional but digital is pretty fun too.</p>

<p>Some artists who make/made art I like are Louis Wain, Daniel Cowes, Nicolas de StaÃ«l and Ed Clark.</p>

<p>I want to develop my latest roll myself so I'm going to have to get my equipment and chemicals together before I can see or share any of the stuff I've taken. Looking forward to that.</p>

<div id="music2">
<h2>music (that I listen to)</h2>
<p>I use MusicBee (win) and VLC (mac, android) to listen to my local files, some of which are downloads and some of which are my own rips of CDs I own. I'm trying to build my library back up.</p>
<p>I'm big on indie rock (pavement, dinosaur jr), indie folk (jason molina, phil elverum, elliott smith), emo (mentioned below), electronic stuff (squarepusher, boards of canada), slowcore (red house painters, codeine, duster) etc.</p>
<p>I also like a bit of indutrial (NIN, ministry), post rock (gy!be, mogwai, laura), alt rock (nirvana, manics, radiohead), pop/hyperpop (underscores, charli xcx, sophie) and jazz, mostly piano stuff but not exclusively (count basie, wes montgomery, monk).</p>
<p>15/6/24: I've been on an emo kick lately, such as City of Caterpillar, the Get Up Kids, Orchid, Elliott, Modern Baseball. Some other stuff I've been into are Mount Eerie/The Microphones/Phil Elverum, Songs:Ohia/Jason Molina, Bright Eyes and Modest Mouse.</p>
<p>Music I've listened to while making this website</p>
<ul>
<li>Modest Mouse - Building Nothing out of Something (album)</li>
<li>Modest Mouse - Good News for Bad People (album)</li>

<p>My all time favourite game (series) would be Doom. I mostly play old school FPS games so that checks out. I haven't been playing as much as I used to but I've started (15/6/24) working on a doom WAD of my own, which is pretty exciting. The Doom RPG games are also pretty fun, hell I even gave Mighty Doom a spin last year. Nothing beats the original though.</p>
<p>Besides Doom I also enjoy Quake (unsurprisingly) and Half life. The portal games were pretty fun too.</p>
<p>Right now (15/6/24) I'm playing Final Fantasy 7. I started playing it a long time ago (got about to near the end of disk 1), but I stopped playing for a really long time. Recently, I've gotten back on it.</p>
