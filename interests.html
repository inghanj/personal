<h2>music (that I listen to)</h2>
<p>Quick recommendations: <a href="_target" href="https://bloodofapomegranate.bandcamp.com/album/noise-for-artsakh">noise for atsakh</a>, to be updated</p>

<p>I use <a target="_blank" href="https://getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a> (win) and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> (mac, android) to listen to my local files, some of which are downloads and some of which are my own rips of CDs I own. I'm trying to build my library back up.</p>
<p>I'm big on indie rock (pavement, dinosaur jr), indie folk (jason molina, phil elverum, elliott smith), emo (mentioned below), electronic stuff (squarepusher, boards of canada), slowcore (red house painters, codeine, duster) etc.</p>
<p>I also like a bit of industrial (NIN, ministry), post rock (gy!be, mogwai, laura), alt rock (nirvana, manics, radiohead), pop/hyperpop (underscores, charli xcx, sophie) and jazz, mostly piano stuff but not exclusively (count basie, wes montgomery, monk).</p>

<p><b>15/6/24</b>: I've been on an emo kick lately, such as City of Caterpillar, the Get Up Kids, Orchid, Elliott, Modern Baseball. Some other stuff I've been into are Mount Eerie/The Microphones/Phil Elverum, Songs:Ohia/Jason Molina, Bright Eyes and Modest Mouse.</p>

<p><b>19.6.24</b>: Just got Sunny Day Real Estate and At The Drive In's discogs. I've only listened to one album from each so far - Diary and Relationship of Command respectively.

<p>Music I've listened to while making this website</p>
<ul>
<li>Modest Mouse - Building Nothing out of Something (album)</li>
<li>Joyce Manor - I'm Always Tired</li>
<li>Jeff Rosenstock - SOFT LIVING</li>
<li>Orchid - Dance Tonight! Revolution Tomorrow!</li>
</ul>

<div id="film">
<h2>film</h2>
<p>My favourite film of all time has to be martin scorcese's taxi driver. I am also an avid fan of gregg araki and gus van sant's work.</p>
<p><b>16.6.24</b>: Going to be watching a lot of movies on the cold war over the term break for history. Will update</p>
<p><b>21.6.24</b>: I watched Full Metal Jacket yesterday, it was bloody awesome, the first part was really funny and the second part devastating. I was pretty much glued to the screen the whole damn time. I'll never know what it's like to be in the marines but I felt real bad for Lawrence. Today I watched Dr. Strangelove, though I wasn't paying full attention to it. I did find it pretty funny at moments though. I should probably rewatch it some time later.</p>
<p><b>22.6.24</b>: Apocalypse Now: damn that scene with the (SPOILERS!!!! Hover to reveal...if you DARE...) <span class="spoiler">severed head</span> was gnarly. what was more gnarly was my fucking wrap with tempeh in it. shit it had mayo and tomato and lettuce, what you'd have with chicken, but it wasn't chicken, it was tempeh. now THAT was really fucked up, it was like a cross cultural wrap. like having udon noodles and pasta sauce. fucked up. the thing that should not be</p>

<div id="reading">
<h2>reading</h2>
<p>I haven't been big on reading lately, but I recently finished <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius">Letters from a Stoic</a> by Seneca (yes, all 124 of them...though I did skim a lot of the latter stuff). I'm reading Marcus Aurelius' <a target="_blank" href="http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html">Meditations</a> next. I've got a big backlog of philosophy books that I want to get through which is definitely gonna take some time... I'm looking forward to reading some Hegel and Shopenhaur, maybe some more obviously political stuff too like Marx and Engels (after all they were young Hegelians). On fiction, I'm also reading Dune but I haven't actually picked it up in a while.</p>

<p>My all time favourite game (series) would be Doom. I mostly play old school FPS games so that checks out. I haven't been playing as much as I used to but I've started (15/6/24) working on a doom WAD of my own, which is pretty exciting. The Doom RPG games are also pretty fun, hell I even gave Mighty Doom a spin last year. Nothing beats the original though.</p>

<img class="gif" width="100px" alt="spinning logo of quake, which is a styalised "Q" - a circle with an opening up top (think a rotated crescent) and a nail through the bottom." src="./assets/cool-gifs/QUAKE.gif">
<p>Besides Doom I also enjoy Quake (unsurprisingly) and Half life. The portal games were pretty fun too.</p>
<p>Right now (15/6/24) I'm playing Final Fantasy 7. I started playing it a long time ago (got about to near the end of disk 1), but I stopped playing for a really long time. Recently, I've gotten back on it.</p>

<p><b>16.6.24</b>: I went on a date with Aerith (yes I am not that far into the game). Spent longer than I would like to admit before I remembered I could drive the buggy over certain parts of the rivers. Oh well, I got a lot of gil just wandering around bumping into random encounters. Looking forward to playing though it probably won't be tomorrow - got to study for the SAC!</p>

<p><b>22.6.24</b>: HAPPY BIRTHDAY QUAKE!!!!!!!!</p>
