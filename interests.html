<div id="music">
<h2>music</h2>
<p>I make electronic and noise music (ok, music is a stretch) with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ableton.com/">Ableton</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://ultraabox.github.io">Ultrabox</a> (though most of my stuff was made with <a target="_blank" href="https://jummb.us">Jummbox</a>). I've dabbled a bit with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/">FL Studio</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a>, I've tried <a target="_blank" href="http://www.famitracker.com/">famiTracker</a> too (sorry tracker purists), but right now, my main focus is getting used to Ableton. I use <a target="_blank" href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/">Surge</a> synthesizer primarily.
I also use Ableton to record guitar demos. I don't have any finished songs yet, but hopefully that'll change soon.</p>

<p>15/6/24: Some songs I've played/are working on are No Remorse by Metallica and Ex-Creations by Fall of Troy (going to try and record these some time). I mostly play indie/alt rock and metal adjacent stuff but I also dabble in a bit of jazz. 

<p>Guitar: Ibanez gio</p>
<p>Amp: crush 35RT</p>
<p> I started on a cheap yamaha classical guitar.</p>

<p>I've played piano since I was too young to remember. I'm also a percussionist (derogatory).</p>
</div>

<div id="art">
<h2>art</h2>
<p>I mostly do stuff traditionally. I'm most familiar with pen and pencil, though I am trying to learn how to paint (acrylic). I sometimes do digital art too, with which I usually use <a target="_blank" href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>. 
<p>Some artists who make/made art I like are Louis Wain, Daniel Cowes, Nicolas de StaÃ«l and Ed Clark.</p>
<p>18.6.24: over the break, I'm going to be working on a piece on the theme of "distortion" (catch up for unit 1 art - not compulsory, but I'm not gonna do it). There's a lot of directions I could go with this, so definitely going to have a good think about it.</p>

<h2>photography</h2>
<p>Some photos from my first roll (kodak gold, expired 2 decades, ISO 100, developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.camerahouse.com.au/">camerahouse</a>):</p>

<p>The following pictures were taken at Northcote Social Club. I didn't get any pics of Codeine (the main act) but I did get a few of <a target="_blank" href="https://abrokensail.bandcamp.com">A Broken Sail</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://garagesale.bandcamp.com">Garage Sale</a>.</p>

<img class="img" alt="Very strong red lighting of a gig. A woman in a white dress and a red guitar on the stage. The view is slightly skewed. Two figures, cast in shadow, are in front. Very blurry." title="yes, I know these are terribly blurry. In my defence, this was ISO 100 and the room was pretty dang dark, so it was kind of necessary if I didn't want it coming out pitch black." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-20-19.JPG">

<img class="img" alt="Similarly lit, very red. Figure with beanie cast in shadow in front. A blotch of blurry teal off to the right side. In the center is the guitarist. The blur of the shot shows two heads and two guitar necks." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-21-20.JPG">

<p>I want to develop my latest roll myself so I'm going to have to get my equipment and chemicals together before I can see or share any of the stuff I've taken. Looking forward to that.</p>

<h2>music (that I listen to)</h2>
<p>Quick recommendations: <a href="_target" href="https://bloodofapomegranate.bandcamp.com/album/noise-for-artsakh">noise for atsakh</a>, to be updated</p>

<p>I use <a target="_blank" href="https://getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a> (win) and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> (mac, android) to listen to my local files, some of which are downloads and some of which are my own rips of CDs I own. I'm trying to build my library back up.</p>
<p>I'm big on indie rock (pavement, dinosaur jr), indie folk (jason molina, phil elverum, elliott smith), emo (mentioned below), electronic stuff (squarepusher, boards of canada), slowcore (red house painters, codeine, duster) etc.</p>
<p>I also like a bit of industrial (NIN, ministry), post rock (gy!be, mogwai, laura), alt rock (nirvana, manics, radiohead), pop/hyperpop (underscores, charli xcx, sophie) and jazz, mostly piano stuff but not exclusively (count basie, wes montgomery, monk).</p>

<p>15/6/24: I've been on an emo kick lately, such as City of Caterpillar, the Get Up Kids, Orchid, Elliott, Modern Baseball. Some other stuff I've been into are Mount Eerie/The Microphones/Phil Elverum, Songs:Ohia/Jason Molina, Bright Eyes and Modest Mouse.</p>

<p><b>19.6.24</b>: Just got Sunny Day Real Estate and At The Drive In's discogs. I've only listened to one album from each so far - Diary and Relationship of Command respectively.

<p>Music I've listened to while making this website</p>
<ul>
<li>Modest Mouse - Building Nothing out of Something (album)</li>
<li>Joyce Manor - I'm Always Tired</li>
<li>Jeff Rosenstock - SOFT LIVING</li>
<li>Orchid - Dance Tonight! Revolution Tomorrow!</li>
</ul>

<div id="film">
<h2>film</h2>
<p>My favourite film of all time has to be martin scorcese's taxi driver. I am also an avid fan of gregg araki and gus van sant's work.</p>
<p>16.6.24: Going to be watching a lot of movies on the cold war over the term break for history. Will update</p>
</div>

<div id="reading">
<h2>reading</h2>
<p>I haven't been big on reading lately, but I recently finished <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius">Letters from a Stoic</a> by Seneca (yes, all 124 of them...though I did skim a lot of the latter stuff). I'm reading Marcus Aurelius' <a target="_blank" href="/http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html">Meditations</a> next. I've got a big backlog of philosophy books that I want to get through which is definitely gonna take some time... I'm looking forward to reading some Hegel and Shopenhaur, maybe some more obviously political stuff too like Marx and Engels (after all they were young Hegelians). On fiction, I'm also reading Dune but I haven't actually picked it up in a while.</p>

<img class="gif" width="50px" alt="kick ass gif of the cyberdemon from doom shooting at you" src="./assets/cool-gifs/RESIZED_DOOM_EPIC.gif">

<p>My all time favourite game (series) would be Doom. I mostly play old school FPS games so that checks out. I haven't been playing as much as I used to but I've started (15/6/24) working on a doom WAD of my own, which is pretty exciting. The Doom RPG games are also pretty fun, hell I even gave Mighty Doom a spin last year. Nothing beats the original though.</p>

<img class="gif" width="100px" alt="spinning logo of quake, which is a styalised "Q" - a circle with an opening up top (think a rotated crescent) and a nail through the bottom." src="./assets/cool-gifs/QUAKE.gif">
<p>Besides Doom I also enjoy Quake (unsurprisingly) and Half life. The portal games were pretty fun too.</p>
<p>Right now (15/6/24) I'm playing Final Fantasy 7. I started playing it a long time ago (got about to near the end of disk 1), but I stopped playing for a really long time. Recently, I've gotten back on it.</p>
<p>16.6.24: I went on a date with Aerith (yes I am not that far into the game). Spent longer than I would like to admit before I remembered I could drive the buggy over certain parts of the rivers. Oh well, I got a lot of gil just wandering around bumping into random encounters. Looking forward to playing though it probably won't be tomorrow - got to study for the SAC!</p>
