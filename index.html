<h2>introduction</h2>
<p>HEY ALL! Welcome to my totaltly awesome website. Hopefully you'll find something somewhat interesting or amusing here. I'm using this place to put down my thoughts on things like video games, music, as well as just my life, which is definitely very interesting. Well, I told a lie. It really isn't.</p>

<p>Go to the nav bar up top to begin your rad journey. The bulk of the stuff on the website can be found under "interests" - music, art, film, books...<p>

<p>A bit about me before you dive into the website proper? Sure. I'm 16. I live in Australia, Victoria and I am a big fan of a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>I wear glasses (which never fail to slide down my nose or just straight up off my face) and I do not look just like buddy holly. One of the best places in the world is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourlibrary.com.au/locations/realm-library/">Realm library</a>, where I spend a substantial amount of time studying. I find it's good because there aren't many distractions (that is, unless the kids next to you decide to have a gossip the whole time...but I digress).</p>

<p>I am not a hundred percent sure about what I want to do in the future. I'd consider web dev, but I mean, just take a look at this website and you tell me if that's a very bright idea. I've also considered audio engineering, but it does involve talking to people, so... hard sell.</p>
