<h2>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!</h2>
<p>This is the landing page. The page of landing, if you will.</p>

<div>
<p>QUICK INFO: I am trying to keep this website as simple as possible. That means that every* page you might encounter is on the nav bar, so you don't have to worry about getting lost down rabbit holes. The page you are currently on will be highlighted. All links to external sites will open in a new tab by default. Dates are in aus format (dd/mm/yy). There is alt text for all images and gifs, let me know if it works or not if you have a screen reader, can also <a href="contact.html">email me</a> if you want a copy of the alt text.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">

<p><b>19.6.24 Wed</b>: <a href="studies.html">studies, new entry</a></p>

<p>HEY ALL! Welcome to my totaltly awesome website. Hopefully you'll find something somewhat interesting or amusing here. I'm using this place to put down my thoughts on things like video games, music, 

. Go to the nav bar up top to begin your rad journey. The bulk of the stuff on the website can be found under "interests" - music, art, film, books...<p>


<p>A bit about me before you dive into the website proper? Sure. I'm 16. I live in Australia, Victoria and I am a big fan of a lot of stuff.</p>

<img class="gif" alt="corny gif of australia with australian flag filled in, and a jumping kangaroo in front" src="./assets/cool-gifs/AUS.gif">

<p>I wear glasses (which never fail to slide down my nose or just straight up off my face) and I do not look just like buddy holly. One of the best places in the world is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourlibrary.com.au/locations/realm-library/">Realm library</a>, where I spend a substantial amount of time studying. I find it's good because there aren't many distractions (that is, unless the kids next to you decide to have a gossip the whole time...but I digress).</p>

<p>I am not a hundred percent sure about what I want to do in the future. I'd consider web dev, but I mean, just take a look at this website and you tell me if that's a very bright idea. I've also considered audio engineering, but it does involve talking to people, so... hard sell.</p>
