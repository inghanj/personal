<h2>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!</h2>
<p>This is the landing page.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>NOTE: I am trying to keep this website as simple as possible. That means that every* page you might encounter is on the nav bar, so you don't have to worry about getting lost down rabbit holes. The page you are currently on will be highlighted. All links to external sites will open in a new tab by default. Dates are in aus format (dd/mm/yy). There is alt text for all images and gifs, let me know if it works or not if you have a screen reader, can also <a href="contact.html">email me</a> if you want a copy of the alt text.</p>

<p>HEY ALL! Welcome to my totaltly awesome website. Hopefully you'll find something somewhat interesting or amusing here. I'm using this place to put down my thoughts on things like video games, music (a LOT of music) and other things. Go to the nav bar up top to begin your rad journey. The bulk of the stuff on the website can be found under "interests" - music, art, film, books...it has everyhing!<p>
<p>A bit about me before you dive into the website proper? Sure. I'm 16, I live in Australia, Victoria and I am a big fan of a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>I wear glasses (which never fail to NOT slide down my nose or just straight up off my face) and I do not look just like buddy holly. One of the best places in the world is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourlibrary.com.au/locations/realm-library/">Realm library</a>. I am not a hundred percent sure what I want to do in the future, but I'm thinking web dev or audio eng as possible career options. I'll see, I guess. As of now I'm thinking of studying science (physics, most likely, or maybe pure maths) along with music (composition) as a double degree. Not totally sure though.</p>
