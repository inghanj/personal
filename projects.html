<div id="music">
<h2>music</h2>
<p>I make electronic and noise music (ok, music is a stretch) with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ableton.com/">Ableton</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://ultraabox.github.io">Ultrabox</a> (though most of my stuff was made with <a target="_blank" href="https://jummb.us">Jummbox</a>). I've dabbled a bit with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/">FL Studio</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a>, I've tried <a target="_blank" href="http://www.famitracker.com/">famiTracker</a> too (sorry tracker purists), but right now, my main focus is getting used to Ableton. I use <a target="_blank" href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/">Surge</a> synthesizer primarily.
I also use Ableton to record guitar demos. I don't have any finished songs yet, but hopefully that'll change soon.</p>

<p><b>15/6/24</b>: Some songs I've played/are working on are No Remorse by Metallica and Ex-Creations by Fall of Troy (going to try and record these some time). I mostly play indie/alt rock and metal adjacent stuff but I also dabble in a bit of jazz. 

<p>Guitar: Ibanez gio</p>
<p>Amp: crush 35RT</p>
<p> I started on a cheap yamaha classical guitar.</p>

<p>I've played piano since I was too young to remember. I'm also a percussionist (derogatory).</p>
</div>

<div id="art">
<h2>art</h2>
<p>I mostly do stuff traditionally. I'm most familiar with pen and pencil, though I am trying to learn how to paint (acrylic). I sometimes do digital art too, with which I usually use <a target="_blank" href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>. 
<p>Some artists who make/made art I like are Louis Wain, Daniel Cowes, Nicolas de StaÃ«l and Ed Clark.</p>
<p><b>18.6.24</b>: over the break, I'm going to be working on a piece on the theme of "distortion" (catch up for unit 1 art - not compulsory, but I'm gonna do it). There's a lot of directions I could go with this, so definitely going to have a good think about it.</p>
<p><b>22.6.24</b>: I did a lot of work on this today. I'll call it "The Poison Generation" because Todd Hayne's "Poison" was a big inspiration, particularly the "Horror" section. I'm probably going to paint it, so I'm gonna need to do a lot of work on mixing colours.</p>

<h2>photography</h2>
<p>Some photos from my first roll (kodak gold, expired 2 decades, ISO 100, developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.camerahouse.com.au/">camerahouse</a>):</p>

<img class="img" alt="Pitch black in the top and bottom thirds, in the middle is a view of the outside, calm blue sky with a white building in front and a dark green tree." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-07-5.jpg">

<img class="img" alt="Open looking room with beige curtains, light grey floor and two thin windows. In the center of the photo are four timpani drums set up in a circle. To the right is a piano with the fabric cover on. To the left are assorted amps. Behind the timpani is a row of cabinets." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-09-8.jpg">

<img class="img" alt="Two thirds, of the left, mostly black. A lamp takes up the rest of the screen - glowing a soft yellow colour. Right next to the lamp is a pile of film - Kentmere Pan 400, red stacked on two blue." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-11-10.jpg">

<img class="img" alt="Similarly to the last one, two thirds are black. This time the lamp glows stronger, a bright yet muddy yellow circle emits from the lamp. In front of the lamp, slightly askew, is a tipped over bottle of pills." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-12-11.jpg">

<p>The following pictures were taken at Northcote Social Club. I didn't get any pics of Codeine (the main act) but I did get a few of <a target="_blank" href="https://abrokensail.bandcamp.com">A Broken Sail</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://garagesale.bandcamp.com">Garage Sale</a>.</p>

<figure>
<img class="img" alt="Very strong red lighting of a gig. A woman in a white dress and a red guitar on the stage. The view is slightly skewed. Two figures, cast in shadow, are in front. Very blurry." title="yes, I know these are terribly blurry. In my defence, this was ISO 100 and the room was pretty dang dark, so it was kind of necessary if I didn't want it coming out pitch black." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-20-19.JPG">

<img class="img" alt="Similarly lit, very red. Figure with beanie cast in shadow in front. A blotch of blurry teal off to the right side. In the center is the guitarist. The blur of the shot shows two heads and two guitar necks." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-21-20.JPG">

<img class="img" alt="Set with more yellow than red now, to the left and right are figures cast in shadow blocking the view. On the stage is the guitarist. Very blurry." src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-23-22.JPG">

<img class="img" alt="A picture of the bar, mostly black, with the top third of the image yellow with touches of red - assorted posters cover the wall. To the right is a stack of glasses. Pretty grainy picture and there's a stress mark (?) a purple line running down it." title="last shot I took - really didn't realise it was the last. I ran out before getting to the main act!" src="./assets/roll1/C001752-R1-26-25.JPG">

<p>I want to develop my latest roll myself so I'm going to have to get my equipment and chemicals together before I can see or share any of the stuff I've taken. Looking forward to that.</p>
