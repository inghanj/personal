<div id="music">
<h2>music</h2>
<p>I make electronic and noise music (ok, music is a stretch) with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ableton.com/">Ableton</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://ultraabox.github.io">Ultrabox</a> (though most of my stuff was made with <a target="_blank" href="https://jummb.us">Jummbox</a>). I've dabbled a bit with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/">FL Studio</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a>, I've tried <a target="_blank" href="http://www.famitracker.com/">famiTracker</a> too (sorry tracker purists), but right now, my main focus is getting used to Ableton. I use <a target="_blank" href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/">Surge</a> synthesizer primarily.
I also use Ableton to record guitar demos. I don't have any finished songs yet, but hopefully that'll change soon.</p>

<p><b>15/6/24</b>: Some songs I've played/are working on are No Remorse by Metallica and Ex-Creations by Fall of Troy (going to try and record these some time). I mostly play indie/alt rock and metal adjacent stuff but I also dabble in a bit of jazz. 

<p><b>26/7/24</b>: Yikes, I've been slacking a bit with guitar practice. I was getting in a good rhythmn but with another up coming SAC and other music shit to do, my schedule's getting a bit tight. Ah, fuck it, I'm gonna hop on my guitar now.</p>

<p>Guitar: Ibanez gio</p>
<p>Amp: crush 35RT</p>
<p> I started on a cheap yamaha classical guitar.</p>

<p>I've played piano since I was too young to remember. I'm also a percussionist (derogatory).</p>
</div>

<div id="art">
<h2>art</h2>
<p>I mostly do stuff traditionally. I'm most familiar with pen and pencil, though I am trying to learn how to paint (acrylic). I sometimes do digital art too, with which I usually use <a target="_blank" href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>. 
<p>Some artists who make/made art I like are Louis Wain, Daniel Cowes, Nicolas de StaÃ«l and Ed Clark.</p>
<p><b>18.6.24</b>: over the break, I'm going to be working on a piece on the theme of "distortion" (catch up for unit 1 art - not compulsory, but I'm gonna do it). There's a lot of directions I could go with this, so definitely going to have a good think about it.</p>
<p><b>22.6.24</b>: I did a lot of work on this today. I'll call it "The Poison Generation" because Todd Hayne's "Poison" was a big inspiration, particularly the "Horror" section. I'm probably going to paint it, so I'm gonna need to do a lot of work on mixing colours.</p>
<p><b>9.7.24</b>: I've been working on "the poison generation" a lot. I'm just gessoing the canvas today, not gonna put down any paint because I didn't get much sleep so I'll do it another time. The idea I've had has evolved quite a bit. I've landed on one I think is alright and communicates the idea alright, I am a bit unsure on the colours, but I think it passes.</p>

The grass is sloped, you can see the ocean behind the hill and a grey bridge. The sky is white, with the outline of a cloud converging towards the hill to a focal point." src="./assets/poiGen/2.png">

In the foreground, very close to the camera, is another face, mostly covered in shadow." src="./assets/poiGen/3.png">

</figure>

<p>I had a few trials of doing the "distorted" effect on the faces, I can't recreate it digitally, so hopefully it looks alright in the end. I'm gonna tone the canvas a light brown. I want it to have a bit of a film look so for all the dark areas I'm gonna use the same dark brown and also use that colour to darken other colours. I think I might end up using a lighter colour for the sky, it looks quite murky otherwise, but it does contrast nicely with the lighter areas such as the clouds, shirt and road stripes.</p>

<p><b>15.7.24</b> I finished it a few days ago and forgot to update the website on it. The updates also weren't going through, for some reason. Anyway, I'll put up a picture soon. Here's the (work in progress) little paragraph I wrote for it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main idea behind this painting is the perception of others and how that is in itself a form of "distortion". Originally, I wanted to explore Sartre's concept that people view themselves as the "subject", or the "doer" and others as "objects" - and that in interacting with others, you are forced to recognise yourself as the "subject" in other people's eyes - something that is existentially difficult for us to grasp. </p>

<p>Though this concept can be applied to every person alive, I decided to focus on how it applies to people who fall outside of the norm, and who not only battle the existential dread intrinsic to life due to social interaction that everybody faces, but a different kind of dread and stress that results from being the "other" in a larger, social sense. For some, the lack of control over how one is perceived by others, or how one's self image is "distorted" by others, doesn't just result in discomfort.</p>

<p>This isn't all negative - the fact that two people can both have their image be distorted means that they can recognise each other and find safety in that. Those distorted individuals will find each other and create a force for good. My intention was that when looking at the painting, those who are themselves "distorted" can recognise themselves as belonging to the same group as the ones in the painting, while those who subject others to distortion are made uncomfortable and unwelcome. It's meant to be a call for recognition, a plea for all of us to come together, and to fight against what keeps us subdued.</p>

<p>I applied slightly brown-tinted gesso to the canvas and left it for two days. I painted in the sky and clouds, and the next day I went over the clouds because I wasn't happy with how they looked. I painted in everything else, using the same dark purple for the road, hair and shadows. The last part was using thick layers of paint to represent the "distortion" of the figures faces. I thought I was done, but when it dried two days later I ended up painting over the faces again, adding more grey and warm (pink, orange) colours to differentiate it from the rest of the painting.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think the painting is quite far from what I pictured. If I could do it again, I would have spent more time planning out details. In all the drafts I made, I only really put down the vague placements of things and their colours (which I ended up changing anyways), I didn't look much into how to actually paint them. For example, I wish I learnt more about clouds and what type I actually wanted to draw instead of completely relying on my mind. As with the "distortion" on the faces, I greatly underestimated how tough it is to make abstraction look intentional.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like I said, it's a work in progress.</p>
<p><b>15/8/24</b>: Yeah, that paragraph sucks anal balls. Oh well. I think the painting ended up all flat looking, because I didn't have much depth, like having the grass be darker in the background than in the foreground and all that. Well, that's what I'll know for next time. Can't wait for them to take the damn thing down. It's really not my best work. My next one will be better. And I've got to work on my next project. I need 16 models. One will just be me, another will be a cat. I reckon I could get a few animals in there. I should start looking for people before I run out of time.</p>

<p>I want to develop my latest roll myself so I'm going to have to get my equipment and chemicals together before I can see or share any of the stuff I've taken. Looking forward to that.</p>
<p><b>15/8/24</b>: I did that. Develop it. But I've had to just take photos of it with my phone since I don't have access to a scanner. I'll get on that soon. Meanwhile... I got my camcorder back, so I've got some photos from that.</p>
