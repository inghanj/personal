<h2>how I made <del>my millions</del> this website</h2>
<p>I've been experimenting with web dev on and off for a while, usually taking huge gaps (years) in between. So my skills aren't particularly great, but for my purposes it does the job alright.</p>

<p>Code editor</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <a target="_blank" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">notepad++</a></li>
<li>Mac: <a target="_blank" href="https://coteditor.com/">CotEditor</a></li>
<li>Linux*: the default, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/linuxmint/xed">xed</a>? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nano-editor.org/">nano</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Terminal/console</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <a target="_blank" href="https://cmder.app/">Cmder</a></li>
<li>Mac: <a target="_blank" href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm</a></li>
<li>Linux: <a target="_blank" href="https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/">gnome terminal</a> (default for linux mint, correct me if I'm wrong)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using github pages to publish this website.</p>
<p>Planning: <a target="_blank" href="https://obsidian.md/">obsidian</a></p>
<p>*: I used linux (mint, cinnamon) on my old hp laptop that I've since replaced with a macbook. I don't really touch that device anymore, but I will probably get back into using linux one way or another in the future.</p>
<p>The mobile version has rounded corners - I'm not sure if I like sharp or round corners better so I might change it around later. It also scrolls straight down the whole page, instead of just scrolling in the main section.</p>

<p><b>15.7.24</b>: Man, this dick ass website is gonna be the death of me! I removed the oh so large video files, and what's that? Remote end hung up unexpectedly? How dare it hang up on me!</p>
<p>DUDE! Man, I thought I lost a whole ass chunk of my code. That was close. Thank the heavens for reflog. Basically what happened was, I was trying to delete previous commits with the big files (according to this <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">website</a>) but some shit went down. The styles.css was causing issues, hell I don't know. So I ended up panicking and pulling from main to the local repos, and that nuked a bunch of my shit. So I fixed that with reflog (my lord and savior) and some other command. Then I actually scrolled the fuck down that website, and found what I was actually looking for, the shit you need to do for when you accidentally git add . a large ass file and need to get rid of it. So I filtered the trees and shit and it was all hunky dory. Anyway, I'm gonna have a well deserved rest now (it's 10:05pm).</p>

<div id="school">
<h2>school/studies</h2>
<p>I'm in my second last year of highschool and I'm studying MM 3/4.</p>
<p>This website essentially came about when I forgot to take my books home after a rather hectic day, so I ended up taking the weekend "off", something I never would have done otherwise, especially considering I have a SAC coming up (I've made time to study for it next week). On Saturday I started typing out the contents of the website. On Sunday I put it together and published it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'll put here any resources I think are helpful or just fun.</p>
<h3>ENGLISH LANGUAGE/LINGUISTICS</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@HBMmaster">jan Misali</a> makes some videos about linguistics and conlangs, and a bunch of other stuff</div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@languagejones6784">language jones</a> makes cool videos about linguistics
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RheaDawnLanguage">Rhea's Language Academy</a> makes cool vids about languages and linguistics (and also is australian)</p>

<h3>SCIENCE/MATHS</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Kuvina">kuvina</a> makes math and science videos</p>

<h3>Infortmation...</h3>
<p><b>ENGLISH LANGUAGE</b> is mostly about linguistics and analysing speech. The most important stuff we learn in units 1/2 are about analysing texts (which can really be anything), using FIRTAC (certain aspects of texts such as function, intent, tenor...), a skill that is carried over to 3/4. We also learn a bit of child language acquisition (unit 1) and english through time (unit 2), which are pretty cool to know though it wouldn't exactly hurt you not to know them for unit 3/4.</p>
<p><b>MATH METHODS</b> is the "second hardest" of the maths (foundation, general, methods, spesh). The content from unit 1/2 is quite similar to that of 3/4, in my experience it's just more in depth in 3/4 and it certainly is a bit trickier. For anyone doing unit 1/2 now or is planning to, I would advise you get a good grip on the concepts in 1/2 and really understand them fully, that will make 3/4 much smoother because it's a lot of the same stuff.</p>
<p><b>SPECIALIST MATHS</b> is the "hardest" of the maths (though some argue methods is harder). So far in unit 1 we've looked at logic and proofs which are really cool to me (coming from seeing the same symbols in analytical philosophy), as well as algorithms, combinatorics and graph theory.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICS</b> is pretty self explanatory. We've done light, heat, nuclear energy and electricity, and we just got started on motion.</p>
<p><b>MODERN HISTORY</b> is also pretty self explanatory - we've learnt some about ideologies and the great depression. Next term we'll be doing the Cold War.</p>
<p><b>ART MAKING AND EXHIBITING</b> is mostly about how art is curated and displayed in galleries, there's also a component of making your own art, and there's quite a lot of folio work. <del>I haven't actually been to a class yet though.</del> It's pretty chill, in 1/2 at least.</p>

<h3>More about VCE</h3>
<p>We have four units to complete each subject over two years - each unit corresponds to one semester. TBC...</p>

<h3>2022</h3>

<p><b>19/01/2022</b> For a second I was Neo from the Matrix</p>

<p><b>28/04/2022</b> tried to say pink floyd but kept saying pinka flinka. or something</p>

<p><b>22/05/2022</b> Young cats were called ‘triangle’. I knew this to be true but it was quite strange. I reasoned that it was reasonable to call young cats ‘triangle’ because it was simply a word. Our country or school was taken over by an army, we had to show support for the invaders to not be hanged. A group came and shot my friend and then me. We were in a huge building with staircases and a tall roof it was very prestiges and had some glass. I became a ghost and chatted with my dead friend, who I could see once I diwed too, and we flew around as ghosts.</p>

<p><b>18/06/2022</b> I was in a band. THe song dopesmoker was part of an album of disney songs.</p>

<p><b>3/11/2022</b> We were gathered up for mass singing. A song came on describing a pirate ship and rope. We had to hold onto the rope. The song ended up being about trying to hold on to the love for a women, but having to realise that the love wasn’t real.</p>

<p><b>9/11/2022</b> Our school was holding a student concert. I was going to play the taxi driver theme on piano, first, and then play “Walter White” music (later realised it was referring to breaking bad) on my oboe. I had a lesson with a teacher and she said I was ready. Then I realised I didn’t play oboe. That idea was ditched and I asked if I could play it on piano instead. She said yeah. I realised I didnt know what the song even sounded like, and it was the day of the performance. The teacher moved mine to a later time slot so I could get ready. Then, I performed and it was alright. After it or maybe mid way through the song I decided to start a comedy skit. I was really funny. I made some joke about evangelion. And I got cheers. It was very successful. Afterwards there was a slope. The teacher said down there was New Zealand, which was native to the Japanese, and many Russians had immigrated there.</p>

<h3>2023</h3>
<p><b>16/05/2023</b> I built a large airplane in Minecraft and simulated 9/11. The plane cut through the building. I went into the building, which still was populated. It was some sort of resturaunt or cafe with tables and chairs. My “character” in the dream was also friends with a pinky from doom. We went on some sort of adventure.</p>

<p><b>14/10/2023</b> There was a world or game or something. There were a lot of different towns with different houses. I made my home in one of those houses. It was pretty great. I think I explored different houses too. There was a conflict somewhere. Someone might have died.</p>

<p><b>12/11/23</b> There was this game which was a prequel to Half-life- not as in it came out after and was meant to take place before it, but that it was the first game in the series and Half Life was a sequel.</p>

<p><b>12/12/2023</b> Well, most of it I’ve forgotten, but there was something about Postal, and how I’d written out the dialogue or script for the game, and I’d done that for helpfulness’ sake. There was something about Scott Pilgrim, as well, the comics. But the plot was a little different. I was in this house, or an apartment. There were others living in the rooms next to it. It was like a whole thing – we knew each other and all. Something that happened to me, or something I’d done was similar to something in Scott Pilgrim, in the dream, not the actual comic. And I don’t remember much else from that.</p>

<h3>2024</h3>

<p><b>5/1/24</b> Most supremely fucked up dream. Was terrifying. Not because there was much that was actively scary, but because of the impending sense of doom and the nonsensical nature of things. I’m on holiday. We’re at this place and it turns out there is a secret surprise performer – brittney spears. She sings her hit song. Everyone is cheering. Now the lore is that there is this family, with this girl, who had some problem with spears. And this girl and her family was the source of the weirdness in the dream. There were countless stories of things going on with her and her family. A lot of them too complex to remember. One of them was to do with her brother. And her other brother and father. The stories would go that there was some issue that could not be solved between either party because her demands were illogical and contradictory, but somehow that mattered on a deep fundamental level. These stories became internet legends. Somewhere, still on vacation, a young boy asks me about Doom and how he can get it. I think rather he was asking about a specific monster and I said it was in doom 2 so he looked or that. He finds this knockoff on his ipad. I say its not the classic doom but it could be fun anyway. I think the shotgun had three barrels. Another story – was of a boy who was running across the road. Not sure what happened but it was in a similar vein to the ones with the girl and her family although a little less strange. Now I’ve done a bad job at explaining what makes these stories so terrifying but it’s not possible to. Theres just something wrong and immoral about the way the family acts – and also the supernatural things that occur around them. A big part of the horror was the feuds between different groups, hostility caused by the immorality an nonsensicality of things. The horror came from not knowing which side to be on, partly. There was also something about earbuds. Another part of the terror was wasting things. In the dream, I regretted finding out about these urban legends because they shook my world and made me question everything.

<p><b>17/3/24</b> there was a sequel to taxi driver. It was playing in theatres. So I went. It was more like a superhero movie. Not sure what it had to do with the original taxi driver.</p>

<p><b>23/3/24</b> there was something called Plasma, that you could get skilled at. There’s this famous guy who was level 15. he was really strange and mysterious. Sort of a Zizek character. Quite controversial. Related were a few other events. I was with some other people on some sort of adventure. Everywhere was sand. Some of us were looting the place, a few including me didn’t want to. There were warnings about not looting, and I thought bad things could happen. Later the looters would get on a big ship thing, trying to convince me to join. I wrote a list of the non-looters before getting on the non-looter’s big motorcycle ship thing. Locked myself in a room, waiting for other non-looters to come. Another section of the dream we met a man (I used to know) who was a level 35 or something in Plasma, which is unheard of. He looked a bit like Matt Johnson.</p>

<p><b>10/4/24</b> bunch of people were going to space. Was some sort of scholarship program or something. You each got in a ship which looked like a fighter jet, but white and bloated. The rest of us also went to space, but not in your own jet. In space we went to this planet. The ground was all sand and dusty. There was a big castle. It was massive, it reached into the sky which was a cold blue. The castle was decorated heavily, ornate. It looked very cool and grand. Going inside there were many rooms. No artificial light, so the light all came through windows. The rooms were massive, the roof of rooms were thrice as high. It was all very big. Huge. Maybe, the planet was for a species that were much bigger than us. Could be. One room I went to wasn’t completely dark because it had a window. You could see the sand outside.</p>

<p><b>27/4/24</b> was in grayscale. A boy was in this place, something like a temporary realm – purgatory, before being put in another life. He had just died. All his deaths were violent? He had a friend, and he wanted to find his friend in his next life, and all the lives he would live.</p>

<p>Are you bored? I'm bored. Click <a target="_blank" href="404.html">HERE</a> to go see the 404 page.</p>

<p><b>26.7.24</b>: Damn, haven't updated this in a while. I reckon, I think I'll use this section to write things that aren't related to any of those categories. I might move the school stuff here too. That's if I end up using this section much at all.</p>

<p><b>19.6.24</b>: Tomorrow's the last day of school. Whoop whoop. I've got SAC part 2 and then I'm free...pretending that the fat stack of holiday homework I got doesn't exist, of course.</p>

<p><b>20.6.24</b>: Term 2 is over. Half way through the year all ready, god damn... Hope I did alright on the methods sac part 2. It'll be a while until I know. Now over the holidays I've got quite a bit of work to get on with - mostly from art and methods (spec, eng lang all finished) and for history to watch some movies. Probably gonna do Full Metal Jacket tonight. I know it isn't exactly as relevant to the Cold War as some other movies but it was on a few letterboxd lists about the Cold War so it should be alright. Plus I've been meaning to see that one for a while now (along with Xiu Xiu and Apocalypse Now).

<p><b>21.6.24</b>: First day of holidays. I got some papers delivered and I got started on methods homework. Tomorrow I'll finish off the notes for methods and get started on reading the art textbooks. I'll finish the methods exercises and physics practice test while we're away on vacation, when I get back I'll keep working on methods and art.</p>

<p><b>3.7.24</b>: I must have zero brain cells, dude. I was gonna do 8 hours worth of studying for my upcoming SAC but I forgot to take my motherfucking books home. And you know what? This isn't even the first time this has happened. You know when it happened first? MY LAST METHODS SAC! Fuck this shit man. I'm gonna go kill someone. Anyway, I've had to change my plan for how I'm gonna do this, which fucking blows unfathomable levels of dookie.</p>

<p><b>15.8.24</b>: I'm sick. Shucks! Oh yeah, I also moved the school blog stuff over to this section.</p>
